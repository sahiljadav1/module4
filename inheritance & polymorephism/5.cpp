5. Assume that the test results of a batch of students are stored in three different classes.
 Class Students are storing the roll number. Class Test stores the marks obtained in two subjects
  and class result contains the total marks obtained in the test. The class result can inherit the
 details of the marks obtained in the test and roll number of students. (Multilevel Inheritance)
