2.	What is OOP? List OOP concepts

----> 	As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that
		use objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world 
		entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of 
		OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other
		part of the code can access this data except that function.

1. OOPs Concepts:

   - Class

   - Objects

Data Abstraction

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Dynamic Binding

	3.	What is the difference between OOP and POP?
	
1.Definition
oop:OOP stands for Object Oriented Programing.
pop:POP stands for Procedural Oriented Programming.

2.Approach
oop:OOP follows bottom up approach.
pop:POP follows top down approach.

3.Division
oop:A program is divided to objects and their interactions.
pop:A program is divided into funtions and they interacts.

4.Inheritance supported
oop:Inheritance is supported.
pop:Inheritance is not supported.

5.Access control
oop:Access control is supported via access modifiers.
pop:No access modifiers are supported.

6.Data Hiding
oop:Encapsulation is used to hide data.
pop:No data hiding present. Data is globally accessible.

7.Example
oop:C++, Java.
pop:C, Pascal.
